# Grid Keyboard — Design Guide

*Version 1.0.0*

The source of truth for how Grid Keyboard looks, moves, sounds and feels.
The numbers live in code in `Design.kt`; this page explains the thinking behind them.
When adding anything new, check it against these rules first.

## 1. Principles

1. **Controller first.** Everything works with D-pad, A and B. Touch is a bonus.
2. **One way to show a thing.** One focus style, one hint style, one icon family.
3. **Say it when it's useful.** Hints appear when they apply (holding RT, select mode) and disappear after.
4. **Calm by default.** Pure black, one accent colour, no decoration that doesn't carry meaning.
5. **Senses agree.** Sound, vibration and animation fire together and tell the same story.

## 2. Layout and spacing

- Everything sits on a **4 dp grid**: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32.
- Settings content is centred and never wider than **720 dp**.
- Settings rows: 16 dp side padding, 12 dp top and bottom, at least 64 dp tall.
- Related rows sit together in a **card**, with 6 % white hairlines between rows and a small uppercase **section header** (32 dp above, 8 dp below).
- **Nested corners share a centre:** inner radius = outer radius − the gap. Cards are 22 dp with a 4 dp inset, so rows inside are 18 dp. This keeps curves parallel, which reads as "made with care".
- **Depth comes from light, not shadow** (shadows vanish on OLED black): cards are one step lighter than the background and carry an 8 % white hairline edge.
- Scrolling content fades softly at the top and bottom edges instead of being cut off.

**Every screen shape**
- The keyboard's width stops growing at 1000 dp and centres itself on wide screens.
- Its height never takes more than **60 % of the screen**. On short screens (small 4:3 handhelds, split screen) the whole keyboard scales down evenly, so proportions stay the same.
- Settings on narrow screens (under 600 dp wide, e.g. portrait): wide controls (sliders, option pickers, the colour wheel) move under their title, option pickers shrink to fit, colour dots wrap into shorter rows, and the bottom hint bar leaves out its least needed hints ("Close" always stays).

## 3. Focus

- Keyboard: the key under focus is filled with the **accent colour** plus a soft glow, and it glides between keys (110 ms).
- Settings: the focused row gets a **2 dp white ring** on a lifted surface, faded in over 140 ms. It stays readable on any colour (WCAG two-colour focus indicator).
- Pressing A on a row gives a tiny press-in (98.5 %) and release, so every action feels physical. Rows that only show information don't react.
- Changing section slides the new page in from the side you moved towards.
- Up and Down never leave a page by accident. The first and last rows hold focus.

## 4. Colour and contrast

- Backgrounds are OLED black or near-black.
- The keyboard never covers the app with Android's full-screen typing box: you always type straight into the app's own field. The accent is the only saturated colour.
- Text on any key is picked automatically, white or near-black, by the WCAG contrast formula.
- Small text must reach 4.5:1 contrast, icons and focus rings 3:1.

## 5. Type

- Letters: Atkinson Hyperlegible Next by default (designed for letter clarity), weight adjustable.
- Settings: row titles 16, captions 13, section labels 12 (uppercase, spaced).

## 6. Icons

- One family: **1.8 dp stroke, round caps and joins**, drawn in the same box size.
- Controller badges always sit on a dark disc with a thin light edge, so they read on any key.
- Badges follow the chosen style everywhere (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch), in Settings too.

## 7. Hints

- **Double presses** are one badge with a small "×2" tucked inside, never two badges side by side. In text: `{SELECTx2}`.
- The only hint shape is the **chip**: a soft pill holding badges and a short word, e.g. `[LB][RB] Jump word`.
- Chips list the most useful action first. If space runs out, the last ones drop.
- Where chips appear:
  - Hold RT: they fade in over the tool strip.
  - Select mode: they appear on the space bar.
  - Clipboard: they sit under the cards.

## 8. Motion

| What | Duration | Curve |
|---|---|---|
| Highlight glide | 120 ms, shortening to 55 ms while a direction repeats | emphasized decelerate |
| Key press squeeze | 170 ms | emphasized decelerate |
| Hint chips fade | 140 ms | emphasized decelerate |
| Switches, pickers, tabs | 200 ms | emphasized decelerate |
| Settings page change | 200 ms | emphasized decelerate |
| Keyboard preview panel | 260 ms | standard |

- **Emphasized decelerate** (Material 3, `0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1`): a quick start that settles softly. **Standard** (`0.2, 0, 0, 1`) for panels that move and stay.
- **The highlight never lags.** When a direction repeats, each glide shortens to fit the gap since the last move.
- **Highlight style setting** (after Android TV's focus system: fill, glow, outline, tonal lift):
  - **Glow** (default): accent fill with a soft halo.
  - **Solid:** accent fill only, the simplest.
  - **Outline:** the key lifts one tone, with a 2 dp accent ring 2.5 dp outside it.
  - **Lift:** an accent-tinted surface. The key and its label grow 7 %, with a short accent bar under the label.

  Text on the highlight always picks white or near-black by contrast.
- **Highlight motion setting:** Instant (no animation), Subtle (default), Fluid. In Fluid, the leading edge runs about 30 % ahead in time, so the highlight leans very slightly into the move and then settles.
- **Wrapping** from one edge to the other snaps, with a small pulse, instead of sweeping across the whole keyboard.
- **Panels push, never cover.** When the preview keyboard appears, the page shrinks with it and scrolls in step, so the focused row stays in view.

## 9. Sound

Four **sound packs** share the same ten cues and the same meanings, so switching packs never changes what a sound tells you.

| Pack | Character |
|---|---|
| **Soft** (default) | A short, low thud for weight plus a crisp click for texture, played together |
| **Soft Deep** | The same recipe, with a darker click and more weight |
| **Tactile** | Dry mechanical clicks, no notes |
| **Chime** | Soft mallet notes in C major pentatonic |

**The Soft recipe (from the reference button sounds Emre chose)**
- **Thud:** two very damped low resonances (~150–650 Hz). They last only 1–4 vibrations, so you get weight with no pitch.
- **Click:** a crisp contact (~1.4–3 kHz), gone in 2–5 ms. This is the texture.
- **Material glint** (optional, tiny): brushed metal on caps lock, glass on select all. Enter gets a rounder "thick wood" click.
- **Nothing rings.** Every sound is 40 dB down within 4–15 ms, matching the references. A long low ring is what sounds like tapping a pipe.
- **Thud and click together.** The references have the click 60 ms after the thud (button down, then up); on a keyboard that feels laggy, so both land the instant you press.
- **Bigger action = more thud.**
  - Space and delete are "bigger keys": more thud, darker click.
  - Triggers carry the most weight.
  - Moving the highlight uses only a tiny click.
- **Four takes per letter**, rotated so the same take never plays twice in a row.

**Rules for every pack**
- **One action = one hit** (and one vibration pulse). Actions differ by weight, click brightness and material, never by counting hits.
- **Loudness is mastered into the files**, measured as felt loudness on a small speaker:
  - move −24
  - type and space −16, delete −17
  - on −14.5, off −15.5, lock −13.5
  - select all −15
  - enter −15.5, back −18

  Played 1:1, so Settings sounds exactly like the keyboard.
- **Pitch never varies** between plays; only loudness does (±5 %).
- Settings' volume buttons control media volume, the same one the sounds use.
- **Settings speaks with the chosen pack**, never Android's own clicks:

| In Settings | Cue |
|---|---|
| Move to another row, step a slider or colour | move |
| Switch section (LB / RB) | space (a bigger step than a row) |
| Pick an option | type |
| Switch on / off | on / off |
| Open or run something | enter |
| Close (B) | back, then the screen closes once it has rung out |
| A on a row that only shows information | nothing (nothing happened) |

- Only one pack is loaded into memory at a time.

## 10. Vibration

- Every pulse starts with an **8 ms full-power kick**. Small motors need it to spin up, or light pulses are never felt.
- **One action = one pulse**, matching the sounds:

| Action | Pulse |
|---|---|
| Move | short light tick |
| Type, space, delete, enter | firmer click |
| Switch on, select all | longer, stronger **latch**, fading out rather than stopping dead |
| Caps lock | the heaviest latch |

- The strength sliders change both **how long and how hard** the motor runs.
- Vibration is tagged as touch feedback, so it keeps working in silent mode.
